# AI Application Hub - Sheldon-Bot Edition 🌌

Welcome to my little corner of the digital cosmos! This is a simple website acting as an introductory hub for AI applications, all wrapped up in a **space theme**.

Built as my contribution to a four-site team project, this site features AI-generated images, audio, and video assets. But let's be honest, you're probably here for the main event...

## ✨ Key Features

* **Cosmic UI:** Navigate AI concepts amongst the stars (or at least, my attempt at stars).
* **AI-Generated Everything:** Most of the visuals and sounds? Yep, cooked up by AI. Robots are taking over, starting with my asset pipeline.
* **The Sheldon-Bot™:** Powered by the Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp API, this chatbot channels the spirit of Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Engage him in intellectual discourse... if you dare.

## 🤖 Chatting with Sheldon

He's programmed to appreciate discussions about:
* Science (Physics preferred, naturally)
* Artificial Intelligence
* Anything logically sound and empirically verifiable.

Venture outside these topics, and you might just trigger his condescending charm subroutine. Don't say you weren't warned! 😉

This site was developed by Dong Zhang ([Your GitHub Profile Link]) as part of a collaborative project exploring AI introductions. While the overall project involved a team, this specific site and its quirky chatbot were my primary focus.
